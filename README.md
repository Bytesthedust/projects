As a summer project I decided to recreate Josh Wardle's popular online game Wordle.

Before starting this project, I broke down the game to its basic steps to get an idea on how to create this program:
1. a random five letter word is chosen
2. player begins with 6 guesses
3. player inputs a word
3a. if the word contains letters in the chosen word but not in the same position, they are highlighted yellow
3b. if the word contains letters in the chosen word and are in the same position, they are highlighted green
3c. if the word does not contain any letters in the chosen word, they are highlighted gray
4. if the player correctly guesss the word in 6 or less guess, they win. Else they lose

Searching for a list of five letter English words, I found a suitable file created by user charlesreid1, whom I will link below, and downloaded the file.
